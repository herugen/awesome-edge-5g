Awesome open source projects for Edge 5G solution

## Edge Platform

### Open Source Mano

### OpenStack

### Eclipse ioFog

**Website**

https://iofog.org

**Github**

https://github.com/eclipse-iofog

**Overview**

Eclipse is an integrated development environment built by the Eclipse Foundation, backed by IBM. Eclipse ioFog is the organization’s open-source edge computing platform. 

**Features**

 - Edge application support: It runs an agent on each edge device so you can execute applications through a microservices architecture. 

 - Analytics insights: The Controller hub provides you with remote visibility and analytics insights. 
 
 - Cloud to edge infrastructure: You can link cloud infrastructure to the edge through built-in connectors.
 
 - Edge security: Eclipse ioFog has an open architecture, which means you can connect it with third-party security services. 
 
 - IoT enablement: Eclipse ioFog can be adapted to various use cases, including IoT, through Kubernetes development. 

### ThingsBoard

**Overview**

ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT platform for data collection, processing, visualization, and device management. It enables device connectivity via industry standard IoT protocols - MQTT, CoAP and HTTP and supports both cloud and on-premises deployments. ThingsBoard combines scalability, fault-tolerance and performance so you will never lose your data.

**Features**

 - Provision and manage devices and assets: Provision, monitor and control your IoT entities in secure way using rich server-side APIs. Define relations between your devices, assets, customers or any other entities.
 
 - Collect and visualize data: Collect and store telemetry data in scalable and fault-tolerant way. Visualize your data with built-in or custom widgets and flexible dashboards. Share dashboards with your customers.
 
 - Process and React: Define data processing rule chains. Transform and normalize your device data. Raise alarms on incoming telemetry events, attribute updates, device inactivity and user actions.

### ThinEdge

**Website**

https://thin-edge.io

**Github**

https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io

**Overview**

thin-edge.io is the first open-source and cloud-agnostic edge framework designed for resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

With thin-edge.io we want to provide re-usable and modular components, which are not bound to a specific IoT platform, domain model or vendor. It runs on a wide variety of hardware, from small, embedded Linux (Debian, Yocto, etc) devices with very low RAM footprint to large, multi-core industrial servers (IPC). It comes with multi-language support and aims to provide out-of-the box connectivity, security and device management features on any device its deployed on.

### Secure Device Onboard

**Overview**

An Automated “Zero-Touch” Onboarding Service

To more securely and automatically onboard and provision an edge device, it only needs to be drop-shipped to the point of installation, connected to the network and powered up. SDO does the rest. This zero-touch model simplifies the installer’s role, reduces costs and eliminates poor security practices, such as shipping default passwords.

Secure Device Onboard provides easier, faster, less expensive, and secure onboarding of devices. It expands TAM for IOT devices, and in turn accelerates the resulting ecosystem of data processing infrastructure. Most “Zero touch” automated onboarding solutions require the target platform to be decided at manufacturer.

Key benefits of Secure Device OnBoard include:

Enables Build-to-Plan Model — ODMs can build identical IOT devices in high volume using a standardized manufacturing process. Reduces inventories, supply cycle times, and costs.

SDO “Late Binding”– allows the device’s target platform to be selected “late” in the supply chain, at first power-on.
It’s Open – means its service & cloud independent. Devices are bound to target the ecosystem at install. Works with existing cloud services, it does not replace them.
